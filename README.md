# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application  

This project is a simple yet engaging **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of **Task-03 for Prodigy Infotech Internship**. The game allows **two players** (X and O) to play alternately on a 3x3 grid. The JavaScript logic handles user clicks, updates the game state, checks for winning combinations, and declares the winner or a draw. The UI is styled with CSS to provide a modern, responsive, and interactive experience.
